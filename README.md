# Earthquakes-2023-Project
The project contains exploratory, geospatial, regression, cluster analysis, and time-series analysis.

# Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze earthquake data for the 2023 year using various data analysis and visualization techniques. By examining earthquake characteristics such as magnitude, depth, and spatial distribution, the project aims to gain insights into seismic activity patterns, contributing to our understanding of earthquake processes and hazard assessment.

# Context:
Earthquakes are natural phenomena that pose significant risks to human populations and infrastructure. Understanding the characteristics and patterns of seismic activity is crucial for mitigating earthquake hazards and improving disaster preparedness efforts. This project utilizes earthquake data to explore correlations, spatial distributions, and influencing factors of seismic events.

# Key Questions:
1. What were the spatial and temporal patterns of seismic activity observed in the earthquake data for the year 2023?
2. How did earthquake magnitudes and depths vary across different regions during the year?
3. What correlations existed between earthquake parameters such as magnitude, depth, and the number of seismic stations reporting the event?
